        <pre class="p5">
            in 2019, i enrolled myself as a psychology student with the intention of discovering myself.
            one thing that i did discover about myself is that psychology isn't really my passion.

            a few months after my discovery, i got into programming because most of my friends were too.
            when i first started learning it, i immediately fell in love with it.

            i love the feeling of satisfaction that comes after <span class="blue">solving</span> a difficult problem.
            i love the magic of <span class="blue">creating</span> something out of nothing.

            <p class="p6">why should you hire me?</p>
            <pre class="p7">
        - I have <span class="blue">good time management</span>.
          I had always finished my student assignments on time and never arrived late to class.

        - I am <span class="blue">hardworking</span>.
          I still took the time to learn programming despite my busy student life.

        <span class="blue">  I am constantly trying to improve myself, both as a person and a programmer.</span>
